                <h2>About Rondo of Wizardry and Love</h2>
                <p><b>Rondo of Wizardry and Love</b> is a tactics RPG set in America in the year 2027. The game is based on the "legend" that people gain wizard powers by staying celibate until they are thirty years old. As you may already tell, the game is comedic in nature.</p>
                <p>The story follows a thirty year old businessman named Luciano who comes home to find a strange portal and his "wife" Homura missing. When he steps through the portal, he emerges into a new world, and his wizard powers are awakened. He and his friends then set out on a journey to rescue Homura.</p>
                <p>In this blog post, we will see the crew that Luciano musters to help him in his journey to rescue his wife.</p>
